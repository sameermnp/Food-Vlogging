                <li>You may have seen posting people videos of them doing weird activities on internet,
                in these weird activities there are also some video on eating of food where these people
                eat alot of food just to attract viewers and gain popularity. Maybe there are some advantages
                and disadvantages of doing food vlogging, like they gain a lot of money by vlogging.
                But apart from advantages there are many disadvantages, they suffer from potential food poisoning,
                putting them into life-threatening conditions.</li>

               <li> These type of talent everyone posses within themselves:<b>Eating.</b>They eat alot of food in a very
                short period of time. Merely eating alot of food in a short period of time can be considered as a kind of talent, they
                are just eating the food to finish it, not enjoying it. There are some eating habbits and 
                manner that are needed to be followed while eating. We should eat slowly, chew it properly and enjoy the
                taste of the food we are eating. These vloggers eat very fast and swallow it 
                without chewing, to finish the task in the limited period of time. </li>
            </p>
            <p>
               <li> In the news of China they said that the vloggers eat alot of food in front of the camera and after 
                finishing the shoot they force themselves to vomit what they eat.</li>
